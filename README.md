# Messenger

## Project Overview

The Messenger Project is a C++ application developed for the Computer Networks class, simulating a chat application with a client-server architecture. The project demonstrates key principles of networking, database integration, and software design, making it a robust example of how to implement real-time communication systems.

The application supports basic chat functionalities and is designed to handle multiple users.

## Features

**Client-Server Architecture**: 

The project is built with two main modules:

* Client Module: Sends user requests to the server and diplays on terminal the answer recieved from server.
